*********************  ApkInstaller *****************
	An apk used to install other apks & copy certain
files to certain destination after every factory reset.
These apk you may remove, show up after  the next factory
reset.

	You may feel confuse when you come to the key lines.
The reason is I work for a phone device company, so we
mess up with the system partition. :)

	The biggest problem comes to me, which still not
sure I fixed it, is NP exception occures onStartCommand().
You can see this from git log.

	This is my first github project. I may not update
this any more.
